## The World

One hundred years ago, dimensional rifts tore open across the globe. They called it the Fracture.

The rifts brought destruction—cities twisted, landscapes transformed, reality itself scarred. But they also brought something unexpected: beings from other dimensions, now stranded in our world.

The **Grankiki** are small insectoid creatures, barely four feet tall, with heads resembling chameleons—especially the eyes, which move independently and see everything. Short-lived but numerous, they are almost never seen alone. Their pack mentality and rapid generations have made them both adaptable and formidable.

The **Bouaux** are long-lived bird-like beings who undergo a dramatic metamorphosis. For their first century, they are human-sized and capable of gliding. Then they transform, growing massive—resembling the ancient brontosaurus—and losing their ability to fly. In this second phase, they become living repositories of wisdom, often settling in one place for the remaining centuries of their lives.

The **Unmoored** are the strangest arrivals. You know one is present—you can sense them, feel their attention—but describing them is nearly impossible. They exist like half-remembered dreams, their forms slipping from memory even as you look at them. They don't speak; instead, their intentions arrive as what can only be described as "vibes," a direct transmission that many find deeply unsettling.

These newcomers, now stranded, have adapted to their new world. In some places they've thrived—Grankiki families run markets in Chrome Bay, young Bouaux glide between Apex City's towers, even a few Unmoored have found roles as couriers and information brokers. But elsewhere, they face hostility. Many humans blame them for the Fracture's destruction. Others fear them as threats. The Unmoored especially face suspicion wherever they go.

Over the past century, a new equilibrium has emerged—not equality, but coexistence. And in this changed world, one thing has captured everyone's imagination: combat.

The Fracture left more than scars and strangers. It left **Spirit energy**—a power that flows through all living things, stronger in some places than others, especially near **Fracture Zones** where reality remains thin. Those who master Spirit energy can channel it into techniques beyond normal physical limits. And those who can fight, truly fight, have become the new celebrities, warriors, and power brokers.

Four major factions dominate the fighting world:

**The Masters' Circle** preserves traditional martial arts, refined over generations. They believe discipline and perfect technique are the path to mastery. Their fighters move with precision, every action deliberate, every form honored.

**The Uncounted** emerged from the streets and shadows—those who fell through society's cracks after the Fracture. They fight with pragmatic brutality, using techniques designed to confuse and overwhelm. They have no use for rules or tradition. Survival is the only honor.

**Titan Entertainment** turned fighting into spectacle. This powerful corporation broadcasts matches to millions, making stars of fighters bold enough to perform. Their style emphasizes raw power and showmanship—fights that look as good as they feel, techniques that make crowds roar.

**The Awakened** study the Fracture itself, seeking enlightenment through understanding the dimensional energies that changed everything. They've learned to channel Spirit energy for healing and protection, blending spirituality with combat in ways that seem almost supernatural.

In arenas and underground clubs, in mountain dojos and corporate stadiums, fighters from every faction and species compete. Some seek glory. Others seek redemption. Some fight for money, others for honor.

But all of them fight in the shadow of the Fracture—that moment a century ago when the world broke open and everything changed.

Your journey as a fighter begins now.
