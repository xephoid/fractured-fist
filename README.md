## The Game

This is an implementation of the game "Fractured Fist" developed by Zeke Swepson. You can review the game rulese here: [Game Rules](FRACTURED_FIST_RULES.md).

## The World

One hundred years ago the world was forever change when dimensional rifts opened up across the globe called the Fracture. In addition to causing mass destruction, the rifts brought through some new sentient beings.

The Grankiki, small insectoid creatures with heads that resemble chameleons. They are short lived, but have a high reproductive rate. It is very rare to see a lone Grankiki, as they are very social creatures.

The Bouaux, large birdlike creatures that are long lived and go through a transformation similar to metamorphosis. In their second stage they grow extremely large and resemble dinosaurs, specifically the Brontosaurus. They are known for their intelligence and are often seen as guardians of natural resources.

The Unmoored, decidedly the strangest of the new arrivals. While they are easily perceived as humanoids, when asked to describe the appearance of an Unmoored, those not of their kind describe them as something half remembered. Like from a dream. Additionally, they do not communicate audibly, instead their intent is percived through what can best be described as "vibes".

These new arrivals, now stranded, have learned to adapt to the world around them and in some places have even thrived along side humans. However, in other places they have been met with hostility and persecution. Especially the Unmoored who most humans find unsettling.

Some humans blame the non-human arrivals for the destruction caused by the dimensional rifts. Others see them as a threat to their way of life. And still others see them as a new opportunity for progress and innovation. Either way the humans have been forced to adapt and over the course of 100 years a new status quo has been established.

One of the main forms of entertainment in this new world are the fighting tournaments. These are held in arenas and are often sponsored by powerful individuals or groups. The fighters are often paid handsomely for their participation and the winner is crowned the World Champion.

There are four major factions that participate in the tournaments. The Master's Circle, the Uncounted, Titan Entertainment, and the Awakened. Each faction has their own unique style of fighting and their own unique way of training their fighters.

The Master's Circle is a prestigious organization that trains the best fighters from around the world. They are known for their strict training regimen and their focus on technique.

The Uncounted are an organized crime syndicate that trains their fighters in the art of street fighting. They are known for their brutality and moves that are designed to confuse and disorient their opponents.

Titan Entertainment is a powerful corporation that trains their fighters in the art of showmanship. They are known for their strength and moves that are designed to overwhelm their opponents.

The Awakened are a group of monks who study the remnants of the Fracture. They have learned to channel the power of the Fracture for healing and protection.
