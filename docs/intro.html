        <h1>Fractured Fist</h1>
        <div class="tagline">A World Forever Changed</div>

        <p class="opening">One hundred years ago, dimensional rifts tore open across the globe. They called it the
            Fracture.</p>

        <p>The rifts brought destruction—cities twisted, landscapes transformed, reality itself scarred. But they also
            brought something unexpected: beings from other dimensions, now stranded in our world.</p>

        <div class="species-section">
            <div class="species">
                <strong>The Grankiki</strong>
                <p>are small insectoid creatures, barely four feet tall, with heads resembling chameleons—especially the
                    eyes, which move independently and see everything. Short-lived but numerous, they are almost never
                    seen alone. Their pack mentality and rapid generations have made them both adaptable and formidable.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="species">
                <strong>The Bouaux</strong>
                <p>are long-lived bird-like beings who undergo a dramatic metamorphosis. For their first century, they
                    are human-sized and capable of gliding. Then they transform, growing massive—resembling the ancient
                    brontosaurus—and losing their ability to fly. In this second phase, they become living repositories
                    of wisdom, often settling in one place for the remaining centuries of their lives.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="species">
                <strong>The Unmoored</strong>
                <p>are the strangest arrivals. You know one is present—you can sense them, feel their attention—but
                    describing them is nearly impossible. They exist like half-remembered dreams, their forms slipping
                    from memory even as you look at them. They don't speak; instead, their intentions arrive as what can
                    only be described as "vibes," a direct transmission that many find deeply unsettling.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>These newcomers, now stranded, have adapted to their new world. In some places they've thrived—Grankiki
            families run markets in Chrome Bay, young Bouaux glide between Apex City's towers, even a few Unmoored have
            found roles as couriers and information brokers. But elsewhere, they face hostility. Many humans blame them
            for the Fracture's destruction. Others fear them as threats. The Unmoored especially face suspicion wherever
            they go.</p>

        <p>Over the past century, a new equilibrium has emerged—not equality, but coexistence. And in this changed
            world, one thing has captured everyone's imagination: combat.</p>

        <div class="section-break">* * *</div>

        <p>The Fracture left more than scars and strangers. It left <strong>Spirit energy</strong>—a power that flows
            through all living things, stronger in some places than others, especially near <strong>Fracture
                Zones</strong> where reality remains thin. Those who master Spirit energy can channel it into techniques
            beyond normal physical limits. And those who can fight, truly fight, have become the new celebrities,
            warriors, and power brokers.</p>

        <p class="factions-intro">Four major factions dominate the fighting world:</p>

        <div class="faction">
            <strong>The Masters' Circle</strong>
            <p>preserves traditional martial arts, refined over generations. They believe discipline and perfect
                technique are the path to mastery. Their fighters move with precision, every action deliberate, every
                form honored.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faction">
            <strong>The Uncounted</strong>
            <p>emerged from the streets and shadows—those who fell through society's cracks after the Fracture. They
                fight with pragmatic brutality, using techniques designed to confuse and overwhelm. They have no use for
                rules or tradition. Survival is the only honor.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faction">
            <strong>Titan Entertainment</strong>
            <p>turned fighting into spectacle. This powerful corporation broadcasts matches to millions, making stars of
                fighters bold enough to perform. Their style emphasizes raw power and showmanship—fights that look as
                good as they feel, techniques that make crowds roar.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faction">
            <strong>The Awakened</strong>
            <p>study the Fracture itself, seeking enlightenment through understanding the dimensional energies that
                changed everything. They've learned to channel Spirit energy for healing and protection, blending
                spirituality with combat in ways that seem almost supernatural.</p>
        </div>

        <p>In arenas and underground clubs, in mountain dojos and corporate stadiums, fighters from every faction and
            species compete. Some seek glory. Others seek redemption. Some fight for money, others for honor.</p>

        <p>But all of them fight in the shadow of the Fracture—that moment a century ago when the world broke open and
            everything changed.</p>
